1. created .env to store database information
2. created /expense/v1/expenses api, which supports query params
- userId
- limit
- offset
- status

GET request on /expense/v1/expenses?userId=415d00ba-f6f1-4168-a6a3-169ef748b39c
will return all expense for this userID


what can be done and refactored in future
1. Use of api documentation and swagger views
2. Postgres ORM
